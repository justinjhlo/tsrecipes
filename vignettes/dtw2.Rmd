To cluster, we need to measure the distance between every member of the group.
Typically we think of [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20Euclidean%20distance,metric%20as%20the%20Pythagorean%20metric.):
the length of a straight line between to points.

This distance pops up all the time in data science,
usually called Mean Squared Error (MSE) or 
it's counterpart Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
It's used to measure regression error in machine learning,
and assess the accuracy of a [time series forecast](https://otexts.com/fpp3/accuracy.html).

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The distance between the forecast and the actual model is calculated by the Euclidean distance between corresponding points in the time series and the forecasts. Evaluation of time series models is typically calculated using Euclidean distance "}

aus_train <- tsibbledata::aus_production %>% filter_index("1992 Q1" ~ "2006 Q4")

beer_fit <- aus_train %>%
  model(
    Mean = MEAN(Beer),
    `Naïve` = NAIVE(Beer),
    `Seasonal naïve` = SNAIVE(Beer)
  )

beer_fc <- beer_fit %>% forecast(h=14)

beer_fc %>%
  autoplot(filter_index(aus_train, "2007 Q1" ~ .), level = NULL) +
  autolayer(filter_index(aus_production, "2007 Q1" ~ .), color = "black") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Forecast"))
```

A straight line between two points isn't always the possible. 
In a city grid, we are constrained by the blocks, so the distance
between two points is called the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("283px-Manhattan_distance.svg.png")
```

As I'll demonstrate in the next section that time series also
need a special distance metric. The most common is called Dynamic Time Warping.

## Time Series Distance

Plotted below are three time series. I've plotted blue and green to both
overlap red. Which do you think is "closer" in distance, intuitively?

```{r}
eth_sample <- ethanol %>%
  filter(id %in% c(1, 2, 53))

plot_overlap <- function(ids, x) {
  group_colors <- c(`1` = "#F8766D", `2` = "#619CFF")
  if (any(ids != c(1, 2))) {
    group_colors <- c(`1` = "#F8766D", `53` = "#00BA38")
  }
  
  x %>%
    filter(id %in% ids) %>%
    mutate(n = list(1:1751)) %>%
    unnest(c(ts, n)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(n, ts, color = as.factor(id), group = id)) +
    geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_color_manual(values = group_colors) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
}

plots <- list(c(1, 2), c(1, 53)) %>%
  map(plot_overlap, eth_sample)

plots[[1]] / plots[[2]]
```

I think it's blue: blue and red both has an early dip after 750. 
Around 1000 they both have a slim, deep trough. The major difference is that
blue seems shifted to the left.

Green is all wrong: where red dips around 750, green has a bump. 
And the dip after 1000 is wider and shallower. 

The Euclidean distance tells a different story. 
Red is actually closer to green, because it has a smaller distance metric 
(9.78 vs 9.83).

```{r}
eth_sample$ts %>% 
  set_names(c("red", "blue", "green")) %>%
  simplify2array() %>% t() %>%
  dist()
```

## Dynamic Time Warping

To capture our intuition about the similarity of red and blue,
we need a new metric. This metric can't simply measure the point-to-point 
distance between the series.
As we saw, blue is shifted to the left, even though the shape
is really similar. We need *time warping*!

In the visualizations below^[https://www.r-bloggers.com/time-series-matching-with-dynamic-time-warping/], 
you can see how dynamic time warping stretches
(warps) time to match up nearby points. 

```{r}
dtw::dtw(eth_sample$ts[[1]], eth_sample$ts[[2]]) %>%
  dtw::dtwPlotTwoWay(xts = eth_sample$ts[[1]], yts = eth_sample$ts[[2]])
```

When comparing red to green, there is a lot more warping going on to match up 
points (as measured by the light gray concentric lines between the series).

```{r}
dtw::dtw(eth_sample$ts[[1]], eth_sample$ts[[3]]) %>%
  dtw::dtwPlotTwoWay(xts = eth_sample$ts[[1]], yts = eth_sample$ts[[3]])
```

The ˇdissimilarity between red and green is reflected when we
calculate the dynamic time warping distance.

```{r}
eth_sample$ts %>% 
  set_names(c("red", "blue", "green")) %>%
  simplify2array() %>% t() %>%
  dist(method = "DTW")
```


## Clustering Time Series
