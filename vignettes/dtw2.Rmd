To cluster, we need to measure the distance between every member of the group.
Typically we think of [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20the%20Euclidean%20distance,metric%20as%20the%20Pythagorean%20metric.):
the length of a straight line between to points.

This distance pops up all the time in data science,
usually called Mean Squared Error (MSE) or 
it's counterpart Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
It's used to measure regression error in machine learning,
and assess the accuracy of a [time series forecast](https://otexts.com/fpp3/accuracy.html).

A straight line between two points isn't always the possible. 
In a city grid, we are constrained by the blocks, so the distance
between two points is called the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("283px-Manhattan_distance.svg.png")
```

As I'll demonstrate in the next section, time series need a special distance metric
too. The most common is called Dynamic Time Warping.

## Time Series Distance

Plotted below are three time series. I've plotted blue and green to both
overlap red. Which do you think is "closer" in distance, intuitively?

```{r}
eth_sample <- ethanol %>%
  filter(id %in% c(1, 2, 53))

plot_overlap <- function(ids, x) {
  group_colors <- c(`1` = "#F8766D", `2` = "#619CFF")
  if (any(ids != c(1, 2))) {
    group_colors <- c(`1` = "#F8766D", `53` = "#00BA38")
  }
  
  x %>%
    filter(id %in% ids) %>%
    mutate(n = list(1:1751)) %>%
    unnest(c(ts, n)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(n, ts, color = as.factor(id), group = id)) +
    geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_color_manual(values = group_colors) +
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
}

plots <- list(c(1, 2), c(1, 53)) %>%
  map(plot_overlap, eth_sample)

plots[[1]] / plots[[2]]
```

I think it's blue: blue and red both has an early dip after 750. 
Around 1000 they both have a slim, deep trough. The major difference is that
blue seems shifted to the left.

Green is all wrong: where red dips around 750, green has a bump. 
And the dip after 1000 is wider and shallower. 

The Euclidean difference tells a different story. 
Red is actually closer to green (has a small distance metric).

```{r}
eth_sample$ts %>% 
  set_names(c("red", "blue", "green")) %>%
  simplify2array() %>% t() %>%
  dist()
```

## Dynamic Time Warping

To capture our intuition about the similarity of red and blue,
we need a new metric. This metric can't simply measure point-to-point of the
time series. As we saw, blue is shifted to the left, even though the shape
is really similar. We need *time warping*!

In the visualizations below^[https://www.r-bloggers.com/time-series-matching-with-dynamic-time-warping/], 
you can see how dynamic time warping stretches
(warps) time to match up nearby points. 

```{r}
dtw::dtwPlotTwoWay(ethdtw, xts = eth_sample$ts[[1]], yts = eth_sample$ts[[2]])
```

When comparing red to green, there is a lot more warping going on to match up 
points (as measured by the light gray concentric lines between the series).

```{r}
dtw::dtwPlotTwoWay(ethdtw, xts = eth_sample$ts[[1]], yts = eth_sample$ts[[3]])
```



```{r}
eth_sample$ts %>% 
  set_names(c(1, 2, 53)) %>%
  simplify2array() %>% t() %>%
  dist(method = "DTW")
```


## Clustering Time Series
